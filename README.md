2. File -> Import -> Android -> Existing Android Code into Workspace
3. Browse -> [your_android_sdk_directory]/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib -> check 'Copy projects into workspace' -> Finish
4. Right click on our project -> properties -> Android -> At the bottom, the Library section -> Add -> google-play-services_lib -> OK

Clean your project and it should run now.
