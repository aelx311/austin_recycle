Instructions
============
1. Select material(s) that you want to recycle.
2. Enter your current location. This may be done manually or by selecting "Use 
   current location. The latter will use your device's GPS service.
3. Click the Go button at the bottom to search for locations.
4. A list of facilities will show up sorted according to the distance from the 
   entered address.
5. Selecting one of the facilities will bring you to that facility's details 
   page.

Completed Features From the Prototype Deliverable List
======================================================
1. Material selection implements checkboxes that save state. In the alpha 
   release every material selection had to start from scratch.
2. "Use Current Location" checkbox on Seach Activity to use Location services
   instead of manually entering an address. In our alpha release this happened 
   automatically if nothing was typed into the location text field, but users
   had no way to know it would do that. This makes for a more intuitive UI.
3. 'Up' navigation button in the top left corner. Allows the user to navigate
   backwards through the activity chain: Detail Activity -> Result List Activity
   -> Main Search activity.
4. Result list of facilities is sorted by distance from the user: In our alpha
   release this feature was faked by treating a location's (latitude, longitude)
   tuple as a simple cartesian point and sorting by linear distance between 
   those points. Now we obtain the actual geographic distances between locations
   by interacting with the Google Distance Matrix API for more accurate sorting.
5. Display each facility's distance from the user in the results list.
6. Show all materials accepted by the facility on the Result List and Detail 
   Activities.
7. Show the location of the facility on a map.
8. Button that can call the facility.
9. Button that opens up Google Maps for turn by turn navigation.
